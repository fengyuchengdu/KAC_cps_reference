# *Klebsiella aerogenes* Complex Capsular Polysaccharide Synthesis Loci References

This repository contains a Kaptive-compatible cps loci database for typing *Klebsiella aerogenes* complex (KAC) species.

## Usage Instructions

1. Install [Kaptive](https://github.com/klebgenomics/Kaptive) by following the instructions provided in the repository.
2. Run Kaptive using the KAC primary KL loci.
3. For results flagged as "untypeable," or with identity less than 98%, coverage less than 95%, or missing expected genes, re-run the analysis using the KAC variant KL loci.
